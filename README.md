# My FastApi backend Web Service

This will provide my frontend projects with a REST API Web Service that will handle all of my API calls and data. I'm planning on using Cursor Ai to learn how to use Ai tools to my advantage while coding. This is a personal learning project.

## APIs in development

- Fundraising tracking app API.

## APIs that have been implemented

- Work in Progress

## Tickets for Fundraising tracking app API

- Use cursor to build the backend REST APIs using python and FastApi.

- Using a webscraper to collect specific data from my fundraising page.

- Using Strava Api to collect data, sanatize and deliver to my fundraising tracking app frontend.
